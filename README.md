# Scary Minesweeper
You know how sometimes in minesweeper you get to a part of the grid where there's literally a 50/50 chance for a mine and 
it's really tense because you just spent 15 minutes on the game and you don't want to lose. Well, I was playing a scary game and realized that waiting in anticipation for a jumpscare gives
the player a similar sense of tension. So I thought it might be cool if I combined the tension together so now you have something to REALLY be tensed about.
